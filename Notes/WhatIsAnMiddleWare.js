// A MIDDLEWARE IS A BASICALLY A FUNCTION THAT CAN MODIFY THE INCOMING REQUEST DATA SO ITS CALLED MIDDLEWARE 





// Middleware in Express.js is a function that processes incoming requests before they reach the route handler. 
// It can modify the request/response objects, perform actions like authentication, logging, or validation, 
// and decide whether to pass control to the next middleware or return a response. Middleware functions 
// are executed in the order they are defined in the application.


// All the MiddleWear that we use in our app is called MiddleWear stack
